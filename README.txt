This is a repository of all of the projects done in the CSC 4356 Interactive Computer Graphics course, based in WebGL.

Each project has its own description in the source code, specifically the .html file.  

each project can be observed by putting the html into a web browser, after downloading the correct files and adjusting the file name in the html source code so that it pulls from the correct file.
